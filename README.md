If you want to enable zlib speed up into your WebBroker apps, add one line of code in AfterDispatch event:

procedure TWebModule.WebModuleAfterDispatch(Sender: TObject; Request: TWebRequest; Response: TWebResponse; var Handled: Boolean);<br>
begin<br>
Response.ZlibDeflate;<br>
end;<br>

The library is well tested, but if you found any trouble please notify me<br>
In a modern CPU base, a well written multithreaded app can obtain a boost until 10x<br> 

Thank you and best regards
